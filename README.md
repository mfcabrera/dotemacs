# My Emacs configuration #

Here I am adding my configuration for Emacs. I had an old configuration but
it was really disorganized and it has a lot of old stuff that I did not used
and it only made my configuration sluggish.

Another reason for changing it was that I got tired of downloading stuff and
manually doing everyhing - so this time I tried to use `elpa/el-get/package.el`
combination to avoid managing everything by myself.

It looks that are cleaner ways to do this so I removed a lot of incessary stuff. I am now jsut stored
the custome code and configuration I use not the whole directory.
